INSTALLATION:


NOTES:

The file unpack is a simplified version of these installation
instructions.


This tar file will expand three directories, eispack, d-rex and
fstrack, for eigenvalue routines, the DREX package and the finite
strain tracker, respectively. 

You will need a C, F77, and F90 compiler, and GMT installed. Make sure
your Fortran and C compiler flags are set with environment variables
CFLAGS and FFLAGS (normally they should be already). 

Some F77 code expects to be able to use C preprocessor statements, in
Intel Fortran, this is done by

ifort -fpp




Procedure:

1) Define an environment variable $ARCH to
	whatever architecture you are on, I do this by using uname
	automated in .cshrc like so:

	setenv ARCH `uname -m | gawk '{print(tolower($1))}'`

2) Go to eispack and d-rex directories and make

	First go to eispack, type 'make', then to d-rex and type
	`make', this should build the DREX based libraries (for
	copyright see note above).

3) 

Go to the fstrack directory. Environment variables $GMTHOME and
$NETCDFDIR have to be set to the GMT and netcdf directories,
respectively. (The FSE trackers uses netcdf grd files to read in
velocity fields.) In my case, those variables point to

> echo $GMTHOME/
/usr/local/src/GMT3.4.3// 

> echo $NETCDFDIR/
/usr/local/src/netcdf-3.5.0//

Then, type 'make' and 'make really_all'

USAGE:

The main program is 'fstrack', start with -h option for man
page. Same for other routines. 


STATUS:

Experimental.
