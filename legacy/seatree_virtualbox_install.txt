--- Abstract ---

This customized Linux virtual machine is intended to provide easy
access to a range of freely available Earth science software and data
to illustrate the capabilities of such open source tools, and assist
in teaching map making, data analysis, and modeling. It is focused on
geodynamics and seismology, but can be used for any Earth science
application.

The package is provided in the hope that it will be useful, but
without any warranties. Copyright for the software and data lies with
the original authors whose work should be cited as appropriate.

--- Technical details ---

All of the software we re-packaged here should be fairly
straightforward to install on any Linux or OS-X platform, but the
devil is in the details. We therefore provide a platform-independent
way of using the Linux tools we like; this involves downloading a huge
file (because you'll be running a second operating system, it's like a
second hard drive), but we think that the benefits of having one
consistent installation outweigh the drawbacks.

Depending on your application, you might actually do your work
entirely within the virtual machine, or you might eventually want to
install the software you like the most on your own OS.

We chose to run Fedora 14 Linux, with yum-installed packages, for the
most part, and our own GMT 4.5.7. For a complete list of currently
included software, see

--- REQUIREMENTS ---

- A 64BIT MACHINE. Sorry, VirtualBox won't work with 32bit hardware. 


- A VirtualBox software install, which is freely available for
  Windows, OS-X, and Linux at

  https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

- A copy of our Computing Environment virtual box "hard drive"

  Available as (version 0.3, May 2015)


  * gzipped  (might cause problems on Windows)

    http://www-udc.ig.utexas.edu/external/becker/ugesce/SEATREE64-2015.vdi.tgz

    (This file is 5.2 GB large.)

  * bzipped  (might cause problems on Windows)

    http://www-udc.ig.utexas.edu/external/becker/ugesce/SEATREE64-2015.vdi.bz2

    (This file is 4.4 GB large.)

  * zipped (for Windows)

    http://www-udc.ig.utexas.edu/external/becker/ugesce/SEATREE64-2015.zip

    (This file is 5.2 GB large.)

- Enough disk space, and enough memory (shouldn't be a problem on
  modern machines, including laptops).

--- Downloading the virtual machine ---

Given the large size of the file, download via a browser might be a
problem and timeouts might occur depending on your connection. You
therefore might want to use a download tool such as "curl" or "wget"
(obtain the latter from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm if not
installed). 

This will allow restarting from interrupted downloads. From a terminal
(on Mac OS-X Applications-Utilities-Terminal) type something akin to

curl -C -L -O http://www-udc.ig.utexas.edu/external/becker/ugesce/SEATREE64-2015.zip

or 

wget -c http://www-udc.ig.utexas.edu/external/becker/ugesce/SEATREE64-2015.zip

--- Installing our virtual Linux machine within VirtualBox ---

- start VirtualBox

- select "new" from menu

- choose Linux-Fedora (64bit) as operating system, and use something
  like "SEATREE-2015" as a name

- choose some memory that leaves enough for your other operating
  system, depending on hardware. 2GB should be enough. Use defaults if
  at any stage you're not sure. 

- select "use existing disk" and pick the .vdi file you downloaded
  (best to put it close to wherever your VirtualBox install likes to
   put those "hard drives")

- if this step is successful, your new Linux virtual machine should
  show within VirtualBox as "SEATREE-2015".

--- Troubleshooting if your image will not boot ---

- Make sure the visualization setting for you CPU is enable in your BIOS.
- Make sure PAE/NX is enabled in VirtualBox 
  [SEATREE IMAGE > SETTINGS > SYSTEM PROCESSOR

********************************************************************************
- IMPORTANT - Making your VirtualBox install access the network and
  regular files
********************************************************************************

  If you want your virtual box Linux to use your machine's
  Internet access (very useful to download data, for example), you'll
  need to go into virtual box settings (by selecting your Linux
  drive), then select "network", go to adapter 1 (which should be
  enabled and be attached to "NAT"), then select the "advanced" tab
  and enter as MAC address
  
  08002701FCBD

  There is a way to setup your install to access all local files
  (e.g. UGESCE will be able to read your Mac OS-X files), or use
  shared folders. Instructions to follow.

  To enable the image to access your local (Mac or Windows) files,
  highlight the SEATREE VM in VirtualBox, [SETTINGS > SHARED FOLDERS]

- Now, try to start up the virtual machine by clicking on the green
  arrow within VirtualBox. (Whenever you need to make changes to
  settings such as virtual box' network access, the machine needs to
  be shut down).

--- Using the Linux machine (LOGIN) ---

- If the machine is running, you should see a Fedora/Linux login
  screen with one user, the "Seatree User". Click on the user icon,
  and login
 
User: seatreeuser 
Password: seatree 


  (There might a security warning, disregard it.)

  The GNOME graphical user interface should load and you're presented
  with your user desktop. There are several program icons, on which
  you can click, including some of our own stuff

  If, at some point, you need to be root (superuser) to change
  administrative settings within UGESCE, the password for root is the
  same, seatree.


--- General instructions on using UNIX, LINUX, and the like ---

Can be found on the web. My lecture notes at

    http://www-udc.ig.utexas.edu/external/becker/unix_rome.html

might also be of use

--- Some comments on installed software ---

For an up to date list with version numbers, see the main UGESCE page
at 

   http://www-udc.ig.utexas.edu/external/becker/ugesce.html

- GMT - The Generic Mapping Tools

  http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/

- iGMT - a graphical user interface for mapping using GMT

  http://www-udc.ig.utexas.edu/external/becker/projects.i.html

- SEATREE - The Solid Earth Research and Teaching Environment

  http://geosys.usc.edu/projects/seatree/


And some example for other nice free software, including

- Octave - a free matlab alternative
- g3data - a plot digitizer
- gnuplot - a simple x-y plotter
- Paraview - a 3D visualization tool, e.g. for VTK files
- GRASS - a free GIS system

The machine also comes preloaded with a range of earth science
datasets, which you can access via the folders that are on the
desktop, as well as a number of other scientific software/libraries,
including GMT, netcdf, gnuplot, BLAS, LAPACK, g3data, and Paraview.

To make sure everything works, click on the iGMT and SEATREE icons
which should open GUIs to run the respective software. 

You are now running a full Linux installation which has been
customized to do some Earth science mapping and modeling. You can
customize your copy of the software as you like. 

-- Installing additional software --

For example, if we missed out on a popular package, chances are you
might be able to install it (as root) using

yum install my_favorite_software

assuming you have network access set up.
