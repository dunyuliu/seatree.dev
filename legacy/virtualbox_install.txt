--- Abstract ---

This customized Linux virtual machine is intended to provide easy
access to a range of freely available Earth science software to
illustrate the capabilities of such open source tools, and assist in
teaching map making and solid Earth research.

The package is provided in the hope that it will be useful, but
without any warranties. Copyright lies with the original authors.

--- Technical details ---

All of the software we re-packaged here should be fairly
straightforward to install on any Linux or OS-X platform, but the
devil is in the details. We therefore provide a platform-independent
way of using the Linux tools we like; this involves downloading a huge
file (because you'll be running a second operating system, it's like a
second hard drive), but we think that the benefits outweigh the
drawbacks (such as reduced speed).  

Depending on your application, you might actually do your work
entirely within the virtual machine, or you might eventually want to
install the software you like the most on your own OS.

We chose to run Fedora 14 Linux, with yum-installed packages, for the
most part, and our own GMT 4.5.7 compile. Software security updates
are current as of March 2012. 


--- Requirements ---

- A VirtualBox install, which is freely available for Windows, OS-X,
  and Linux at

  https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

- A copy of our Computing Environment virtual box "hard drive"

  Available at 

  http://geodynamics.usc.edu/~becker/ftp/SEATREE64-2012.vdi

  (This file is 9GB large.)

  

- Enough disk space, and enough memory (shouldn't be a problem on
  modern machines, including laptops). 


--- Installing our virtual Linux machine ---

- select "new" from menu

- choose Linux-Fedora (64bit) and use something like "SEATREE-2012" as
  a name

- choose some memory that leaves enough for your other operating
  system, depending on hardware. 2GB should be enough. Use defaults if
  at any stage you're not sure. 

- select "use existing disk" and pick the .vdi file you downloaded
  (best to put it close to whereever your VirtualBox install likes to
   put those "hard drives"

- if this step is successful, your new Linux virtual machine should
  show within VirtualBox as "SEATRRE-2012".

- IMPORTANT
********************************************************************************

  If you want your virtual box linux to use your machine's
  internet access (very useful to download data, for example), you'll
  need to go into virtual box settings (by selecting your Linux
  drive), then select "network", go to adapter 1 (which should be
  enabled and be attached to "NAT"), then select the "advanced" tab
  and enter as MAC address
  
  08002701FCBD

- Now, try to start up the virtual machine by clicking on the green
  arrow. (Whenever you need to make changes to settings such as
  virtual box' network access, the machine needs to be shut down). 

--- Using the Linux machine ---

- If the machine is running, you should see a Fedora/Linux login
  screen with one user, the "Seatree User". Click on the user icon,
  and login
 
User: seatreeuser 
Password: seatree 


  (There might a security warning, disregard it.)

  The GNOME graphical user interface should load and you're presented
  with your user desktop. There are several program icons, on which
  you can click, including some of our own stuff

- iGMT - a graphical user interface for mapping using GMT

  http://geodynamics.usc.edu/~becker/projects.i.html

- SEATREE - The Solid Earth Research and Teaching Environment

  http://geosys.usc.edu/projects/seatree/


And some example for nice free software, including

- Octave - a free matlab alternative
- g3data - a plot digitizer
- gnuplot - a simple x-y plotter


The machine also comes preloaded with a range of earth science
datasets, which you can access via the folders that are on the
desktop, as well as a number of other scientific software/libraries,
including GMT, netcdf, gnuplot, BLAS, LAPACK, g3data, and Paraview.

To make sure everything works, click on the iGMT and SEATREE icons
which should open GUIs to run the respective software. 

You are now running a full Linux installation which has been
customized to do some Earth science mapping and modeling. You can
customize your copy of the software as you like. 

Should you need to do some more (or less) hard core systems
administration, the root (superuser) password is also "seatree". For
example, if we missed out on a popular package, chances are you might
be able to install it (as root) using 

yum install my_favorite_software
