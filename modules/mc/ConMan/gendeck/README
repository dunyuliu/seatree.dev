GenDeck generates input decks for use with ConMan and related codes.

To install Gendeck:

	make -f GenDeck.mk all install

"GenDeck" will be placed in $CONBIN which should be defined within your ".cshrc"
file.

For other makefile options, see "GenDeck.mk".

A brief description of "GenDeck" is given in the beginning of the main program,
"gendeck.f". The user is given some additional guidance at run time.

The default settings given in 'deck.defaults.h' can be changed to suit the
user's personal preference.
